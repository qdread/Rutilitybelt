Description: Some miscellaneous helpful R functions Quentin likes to use.
   These include a couple of functions for data.table so you can group and nest like
   tidyverse, a "stealth" ggplot theme, a function to read lots of CSVs with fread,
   and a way to get Tukey letters from Bayesian contrasts.
