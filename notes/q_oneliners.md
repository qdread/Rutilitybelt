# Q'S ÃœBER HELPFUL ONE LINERS

## bash

Create and export a function in `.bashrc` which is just like `Rscript` except that `--no-echo` is removed.

```
function Rscript2() { R --no-restore --file="$1"; }
export -f Rscript2
```

Alias to replicate, very simply, the behavior of `dos2unix` to correct line endings of files created on Windows.

```
alias tounix='sed -i.bak "s/\r$//"'
```

Get rid of spaces in all file names in a directory, with a for loop.

```
for oldname in *; do newname=`echo $oldname | sed -e 's/ //g'`; mv "$oldname" "$newname"; done
```

## git

Show the names of files that were modified in the last 10 commits

```
git diff --name-only HEAD~10 HEAD
```

## sed

Replace all occurrences of `string1` with `string2` in all `.md` files in current directory

```
find . -name '*.md' -exec sed -i -e 's/string1/string2/g' {} \;
```

note: If there are forward slashes in the string to be replaced, you can use `|` as the separator.

## R data.table

Using `purrr`, read all CSV files from a directory into memory, naming them after the base filename without extension.

```
walk(list.files('path/to/files', pattern = '*.csv', full.names = TRUE),
     ~ assign(gsub('\\.csv', '', basename(.)), fread(.), envir = .GlobalEnv))
```

note: Add additional arguments to `fread` as needed.

## Rmarkdown header

Header to get the date in a good format:

```
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`"
```

Alternative:

```
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B %Y')`"
```

## Windows command prompt

Symbolic link to a directory (run as admin). Replace the `/d` with `/J` to get a directory junction.

```
mklink /d data C:\stuff\foo
```

In R, run as admin, create a symlink in this way:

```
file.symlink(from = 'C:/Users/qdread/onedrive_usda/ars_projects/xxx', to = 'data')
```

## Regex

In R, get all numbers between two specific character strings without actually getting the characters. The `?<=` within the initial parens means "find text preceded by ..." and `?=` means "find text followed by ..."

```
str_extract_all(x, '(?<=foo)([0-9]+)(?=bar)')
```
